## Set up your local development environment

#### It is recommended to use [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/), but you may follow these steps for a manual installation

- Minimum of PHP 8.2 installed with a database engine that supports JSON types and possibly with full text search (e.g.
  MySQL8, MariaDB 10.5)
- Create a **.env** and a **.env.testing** files from the **.env.example** that came with this project. You may request
  some of the contents of these files from me
- Locate your **php.ini** file and change the value **upload_max_filesize** to **10M**. See
  this [guide](https://devanswers.co/ubuntu-php-php-ini-configuration-file/) if you're having trouble finding the
  directory of your php.ini file
- Make sure you have MySQL and Redis running locally (or depending on what's stated in the **.env** file)
- Run the command `composer install`  to install all the project and dev dependencies
- Then run `php artisan migrate --seed && php artisan app:format-code`
- To check if everything is working as expected, run: `php artisan test`

#### You may also use `Docker` to build the application and databases

```
docker compose up --profile app --profile store up -d
```
